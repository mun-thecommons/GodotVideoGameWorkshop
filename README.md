# GodotVideoGameWorkshop
Files for a video game workshop for building a simple 2D game in Godot. It includes the code for all the main scenes and audio and pixel sprite sheets. 
The sample game was created with reference to a Godot tutorial found on the GDQuest Youtube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEt2JHEe-do&list=PLhqJJNjsQ7KEcm-iYJ2a8UCRN62bTneKa&index=11
All pixel sprite sheets belong to Melody Robateau.
